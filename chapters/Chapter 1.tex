\chapter{Theoretical study of Turing patterns }
Studying turing patterns theoretically:
\begin{itemize}
\item Types of instabilities
\item multistability
\item analytical to numerical
\item no growth to open boundaries to growth
\item dispersion to shape:
    \begin{itemize}

    \item dispersion to convergence time
    \item dispersion to pattern
    \item dispersion to wavelenght
     \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
