\chapter{Theoretical study of Turing patterns }
Studying turing patterns theoretically:
\begin{itemize}
\item Types of instabilities
\item multistability
\item analytical to numerical %todo . They also identify examples of non-stationary spatial patterns, when the eigenvalue corresponding to a critical wave number has non-zero imaginary part.Deutsch, A., Dormann, S., et al., 2005. Cellular automaton modeling of biological pattern formation. Springer.
\item no growth to open boundaries to growth
\item dispersion to shape:
    \begin{itemize}

    \item dispersion to convergence time
    \item dispersion to pattern
    \item dispersion to wavelenght
     \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
